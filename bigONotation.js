// OBJECTIVES
// Motivate the need for something like Big O notation
// Describewhat Big O Notation is
// Simplify Big O Exrpessions
// Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
// Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using  Big O notation
// Describe what a logarithm is

// BIG O NOTATION
// It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow.  
// It's worried about worst case scenario
