// GRAPHS
// A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutalbe)
// set of vetices or nodes or points,
// together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an 
// undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph
// i.e. NODES & CONNECTIONS 

// USES FOR GRAPHS (a bunch of nodes connected to eachother)
// Social Networks, location/mapping, routing algorithms
// visual hierarchy, file system optimizations, EVERYWHERE!
// recommendations "people also watched", "people you might know"

// GRAPH TERMS
// VERTEX - a node
// EDGE - connection between nodes
// WEIGHTED/UNWEIGHTED - values assigned to distances between vertices
// DIRECTED/UNDIRECTED - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

// Directed Graph
// a direction assigned to an edge such as:
// two friends follow eachother, arrows pointing at both vetices
// one preson follows a famous person, arrow pointing only at famous person
// WEIGHTED GRAPH
// shows the value between vertices on edges
// i.e. distances of roads, how much someone gives attention to someone they follow
// UNDIRECTED GRAPH
// just shows connections that are connected, looks like web
// no values on edge
